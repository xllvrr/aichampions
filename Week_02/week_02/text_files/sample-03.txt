On the sunny shores of East Coast Park, lifeguards Ahmad and Siti were conducting a beach cleanup. They traversed the sands, interacting warmly, when a challenge struckâ€”Ahmad's bag tore, spilling trash, and Siti was quick to offer hers. Though momentarily frustrated, they regrouped at their station to supportive peers. Despite the inconvenience, their commitment to the coast remained steadfast, and they resumed their duties with determination.
