Amidst the lively corridors of a local school, teachers Lim and Chua were organizing a charity fun run. As they set up the registration desk, bustling energetically, a hiccup occurredâ€”Lim's stack of flyers scattered in the breeze, with Chua leaping to gather them. Though a bit flustered, the duo made their way back to the starting line to encouraging cheers. Despite the commotion, their resolve was unshaken, and they proceeded with the event with unwavering dedication.
