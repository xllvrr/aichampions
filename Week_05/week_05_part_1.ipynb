It’s akin to setting how “creative” or “safe” you want the model’s responses to be. \\n\\n\\n- **✦ Technically, it adjusts the probability distribution of the next token** being generated, influencing the diversity of the generated text\\n\\t- `Softmax function` is often used in machine learning models to convert raw scores (also known as logits) into probabilities.\\n\\t- In the context of language models, the softmax function is used to convert the scores assigned to each possible next word into probabilities. The word with the highest probability is often chosen as the prediction.\\n\\t\\t- So, if the softmax value for a word is high, it means that the model predicts that word to be the next word with high probability. \\n\\t\\t- Conversely, a low softmax value for a word means that the word is unlikely to be the next word according to the model’s prediction.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ Table below shows candidates of word for completing the prompt *\"Singapore has a lot of beautiful ...\"*.\\n\\t- At a **lower temperature** makes the model’s **predictions more deterministic**, **favoring the most likely next token**. \\n\\t\\t- The resulting probability distribution where one element has a probability close to 1, and all others have probabilities close to 0.\\n\\t\\t\\t- The differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t\\t- In other words, the differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t-  At **higher temperatures*, the new values (i.e., `Softmax with Temperature`) are less extreme**\\n\\t\\t - The resulting probabilities are more evenly distributed. \\n\\t\\t - This leads to **more randomness and creativity in the generated text**, as the model is less likely to pick the most probable token and more likely to pick less probable ones.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ See the following for the illustration of the concept.\\n\\t- There are live examples that we will go through in our notebook\\n\\t- by adjusting the `temperature`, we can control the trade-off between diversity and confidence in the model’s predictions. \\n\\t- A lower theta will make the model more confident but less diverse, while a higher theta will make the model more diverse but less confident.\\n\\n| Word      | Logits | Softmax | Softmax with LOW temperature | Softmax with High tempetaure |\\n| --------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------- | :--------------------------- |\\n| scenaries | 20     | 0.881   | 1.000                        | 0.8808                       |\\n| buildings | 18     | 0.119   | 0.000                        | 0.1192                       |\\n| people    | 5      | 0.000   | 0.000                        | 0.000                        |\\n| gardens   | 2      | 0.000   | 0.000                        | 0.000                        |\\n![](https://d17lzt44idt8rf.cloudfront.net/aicamp/resources/topic02/Pasted%20image%2020240328125030.png)\\n\\n> [!info] **[Extra]** The equations below shows how the \"temperature\" being incorporated into the Softmax function.\\n> - 💡 You don\\'t have to worry about understanding the equation or memorizing it. \\n> - It\\'s more for us to understand the intuition on where is the `temperature` being used\\n> \\n> - **Softmax**\\n> $$ \\\\text{Softmax}_\\\\theta(z_i) = \\\\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_i}}$$\\n> - **Softmax with Temperature $\\\\theta$**\\n$$ \\\\text{Softmax}_\\\\theta(z_i) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{\\\\theta}}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{\\\\theta}}}$$\\n> \\n\\n> [!warning] Calculations that are found on this page are for understanding the intuition behind the key parameters and do not represent the exact ways model providers code their algorithms\\n> - ✦ This applies to the calculations for temperature, top-K, and top-P\\n> \\n\\n> [!Try out in Notebook Week 02] \\n> The live calculation to show the intuition of the `Temperature`  is included in the Notebook of this week.

It’s akin to setting how “creative” or “safe” you want the model’s responses to be. \\n\\n\\n- **✦ Technically, it adjusts the probability distribution of the next token** being generated, influencing the diversity of the generated text\\n\\t- `Softmax function` is often used in machine learning models to convert raw scores (also known as logits) into probabilities.\\n\\t- In the context of language models, the softmax function is used to convert the scores assigned to each possible next word into probabilities. The word with the highest probability is often chosen as the prediction.\\n\\t\\t- So, if the softmax value for a word is high, it means that the model predicts that word to be the next word with high probability. \\n\\t\\t- Conversely, a low softmax value for a word means that the word is unlikely to be the next word according to the model’s prediction.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ Table below shows candidates of word for completing the prompt *\"Singapore has a lot of beautiful ...\"*.\\n\\t- At a **lower temperature** makes the model’s **predictions more deterministic**, **favoring the most likely next token**. \\n\\t\\t- The resulting probability distribution where one element has a probability close to 1, and all others have probabilities close to 0.\\n\\t\\t\\t- The differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t\\t- In other words, the differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t-  At **higher temperatures*, the new values (i.e., `Softmax with Temperature`) are less extreme**\\n\\t\\t - The resulting probabilities are more evenly distributed. \\n\\t\\t - This leads to **more randomness and creativity in the generated text**, as the model is less likely to pick the most probable token and more likely to pick less probable ones.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ See the following for the illustration of the concept.\\n\\t- There are live examples that we will go through in our notebook\\n\\t- by adjusting the `temperature`, we can control the trade-off between diversity and confidence in the model’s predictions. \\n\\t- A lower theta will make the model more confident but less diverse, while a higher theta will make the model more diverse but less confident.'),\n",

LLMs and Hallucinations.txt'}, page_content='<h1>Title: LLMs and Hallucinations</h1>\\n\\n\\n# LLMs & Hallucinations\\n- ✦ One important thing to take note of when using such AI powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they often generate text that appears coherent and contextually relevant but is factually incorrect or misleading. \\n\\t- We call these **hallucination problems**. This issue arises due to the inherent nature of how LLMs are trained and their reliance on massive datasets. \\n\\t- While some of the models like ChatGPT go through a second phase in the training where humans try to improve the responses, there is generally no fact-checking mechanism that is built into these LLMs when you use them.\\n\\n- ✦ There is no easy foolproof safeguard against hallucination, although some system prompt engineering can help mitigate this. \\n\\t- What makes hallucination by LLM worse is that the responses are surprisingly real, even if they are absolutely nonsensical. \\n\\t- Know that you must never take the responses as-is without fact-checking, and that you are ultimately responsible for the use of the output.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Hallucinations &  Common Risks\\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624021097786-e621f5e3d52d?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\\n\\n- ✦ Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for effectively using LLMs and mitigating potential issues. We will explore some of the common pitfalls of LLMs, including issues with:\\n\\t- citing source\\n\\t- bias\\n\\t- hallucinations\\n\\t- math\\n\\t- prompt hacking\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔖 Citing Non-existance Sources\\n- ✦ Citing Sources While LLMs can generate text that appears to cite sources, **it\\'s important to note that they cannot accurately cite sources.** \\n\\t- This is because they do not have access to the Internet and do not have the ability to remember where their training data came from. \\n\\t- As a result, **they often generate sources that seem plausible but are entirely fabricated**. \\n\\t- This is a significant limitation when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate source citation.\\n\\t- Note The issue of inaccurate source citation can be mitigated to some extent by using search augmented LLMs (i.e., RAG that we will be covering). \\n\\t\\t- These are LLMs that have the ability to search the Internet and other sources to provide more accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧐 Bias\\n- ✦ LLMs can exhibit biasness in their responses, often generating **stereotypical or prejudiced content**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large datasets that may contain biased information. \\n\\t- Despite safeguards put in place to prevent this, LLMs can sometimes produce sexist, racist, or homophobic content. \\n\\t- This is a **critical issue to be aware** of when using LLMs in **consumer-facing applications** or in research, as it can l**ead to the propagation of harmful stereotypes and biased results.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🥴 Hallucinations\\n- ✦  LLMs can sometimes \"hallucinate\" or generate false information when asked a question they do not know the answer to. \\n\\t- Instead of stating that they do not know the answer, they often generate a response that sounds confident but is incorrect. \\n\\t- This can lead to the dissemination of misinformation and should be taken into account when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔢 Math \\n- ✦ Despite their advanced capabilities, **Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical tasks and can provide incorrect answers (even as simple as multiplying two numbers).**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large volumes of text and while they have gained a good understanding of natural language patterns, they are not explicitly trained to do maths.\\n\\t- Note The issue with math can be somewhat alleviated by using a **tool augmented LLM**\\n\\t\\t- which combines the capabilities of an LLM with specialized tools for tasks like math or programming.\\n\\t\\t- We will cover this in later part of the training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👺 Prompt Hacking\\n- ✦ LLMs can be **manipulated or \"hacked\" by users** to generate specific content, and then use our LLM applications **for malicious or unintended usages**.\\n\\t- This is known as prompt hacking and can be used to trick the LLM into generating inappropriate or harmful content. \\n\\t- It\\'s important to be aware of this potential issue when using LLMs, especially in public-facing applications. \\n\\t- We will cover prompting techniques that can prevent some of of the prompt attacks/hacking techniques.'),\n",

This issue arises due to the inherent nature of how LLMs are trained and their reliance on massive datasets. \\n\\t- While some of the models like ChatGPT go through a second phase in the training where humans try to improve the responses, there is generally no fact-checking mechanism that is built into these LLMs when you use them.\\n\\n- ✦ There is no easy foolproof safeguard against hallucination, although some system prompt engineering can help mitigate this. \\n\\t- What makes hallucination by LLM worse is that the responses are surprisingly real, even if they are absolutely nonsensical. \\n\\t- Know that you must never take the responses as-is without fact-checking, and that you are ultimately responsible for the use of the output.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Hallucinations &  Common Risks\\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624021097786-e621f5e3d52d?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\\n\\n- ✦ Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for effectively using LLMs and mitigating potential issues.

    "The term np.max(logits) is subtracted from logits to avoid numerical instability that can occur when taking the exponential of large numbers, a common issue in machine learning computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why: the softmax function involves taking the exponential of each logit. If a logit is a large positive number, its exponential can be extremely large - so large that it exceeds the maximum representable number (overflow), leading to inf values. This can cause the softmax function to return incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By subtracting np.max(logits), we ensure that the maximum value in the logits array is 0, which means the largest possible output from the exponential function is 1. This effectively eliminates the possibility of overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, this operation doesn't change the output of the softmax function. That's because softmax is shift invariant, meaning that adding or subtracting a constant from each logit doesn't affect the output probabilities. This property allows us to subtract the maximum logit for numerical stability without changing the function's output.\n",

This issue arises due to the inherent nature of how LLMs are trained and their reliance on massive datasets. \\n\\t- While some of the models like ChatGPT go through a second phase in the training where humans try to improve the responses, there is generally no fact-checking mechanism that is built into these LLMs when you use them.\\n\\n- ✦ There is no easy foolproof safeguard against hallucination, although some system prompt engineering can help mitigate this. \\n\\t- What makes hallucination by LLM worse is that the responses are surprisingly real, even if they are absolutely nonsensical. \\n\\t- Know that you must never take the responses as-is without fact-checking, and that you are ultimately responsible for the use of the output.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Hallucinations &  Common Risks\\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624021097786-e621f5e3d52d?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\\n\\n- ✦ Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for effectively using LLMs and mitigating potential issues. We will explore some of the common pitfalls of LLMs, including issues with:\\n\\t- citing source\\n\\t- bias\\n\\t- hallucinations\\n\\t- math\\n\\t- prompt hacking\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔖 Citing Non-existance Sources\\n- ✦ Citing Sources While LLMs can generate text that appears to cite sources, **it\\'s important to note that they cannot accurately cite sources.** \\n\\t- This is because they do not have access to the Internet and do not have the ability to remember where their training data came from. \\n\\t- As a result, **they often generate sources that seem plausible but are entirely fabricated**. \\n\\t- This is a significant limitation when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate source citation.\\n\\t- Note The issue of inaccurate source citation can be mitigated to some extent by using search augmented LLMs (i.e., RAG that we will be covering). \\n\\t\\t- These are LLMs that have the ability to search the Internet and other sources to provide more accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧐 Bias\\n- ✦ LLMs can exhibit biasness in their responses, often generating **stereotypical or prejudiced content**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large datasets that may contain biased information. \\n\\t- Despite safeguards put in place to prevent this, LLMs can sometimes produce sexist, racist, or homophobic content. \\n\\t- This is a **critical issue to be aware** of when using LLMs in **consumer-facing applications** or in research, as it can l**ead to the propagation of harmful stereotypes and biased results.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🥴 Hallucinations\\n- ✦  LLMs can sometimes \"hallucinate\" or generate false information when asked a question they do not know the answer to. \\n\\t- Instead of stating that they do not know the answer, they often generate a response that sounds confident but is incorrect. \\n\\t- This can lead to the dissemination of misinformation and should be taken into account when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔢 Math \\n- ✦ Despite their advanced capabilities, **Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical tasks and can provide incorrect answers (even as simple as multiplying two numbers).**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large volumes of text and while they have gained a good understanding of natural language patterns, they are not explicitly trained to do maths.\\n\\t- Note The issue with math can be somewhat alleviated by using a **tool augmented LLM**\\n\\t\\t- which combines the capabilities of an LLM with specialized tools for tasks like math or programming.\\n\\t\\t- We will cover this in later part of the training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👺 Prompt Hacking\\n- ✦ LLMs can be **manipulated or \"hacked\" by users** to generate specific content, and then use our LLM applications **for malicious or unintended usages**.\\n\\t- This is known as prompt hacking and can be used to trick the LLM into generating inappropriate or harmful content. \\n\\t- It\\'s important to be aware of this potential issue when using LLMs, especially in public-facing applications. \\n\\t- We will cover prompting techniques that can prevent some of of the prompt attacks/hacking techniques.'),\n",

Prompting Techniques for Builders.txt'}, page_content='<h1>Title: Prompting Techniques for Builders</h1>\\n\\n\\n# Basic Concepts:\\n\\n\\n## Dictionary: A Quick Recap\\n- ✦ In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that stores data in key-value pairs.\\n\\t- The dictionary is enclosed in curly braces { } where the key-value pairs are stored in.\\n\\t- Each key-value pair is separated by commas.\\n\\t- Within each key-value pair, the key comes first, followed by a colon, and then followed by the corresponding value.\\n\\t- Here’s an example:\\n\\n```Python\\nmy_dict = {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 25}\\n```\\n\\n- ✦ In this example, \\'name\\' and \\'age\\' are keys, and \\'Alice\\' and 25 are their corresponding values. Keys in a dictionary must be unique and immutable, which means you can use strings, numbers, or tuples as - dictionary keys but something like [\\'key\\'] is not allowed.\\n    \\n- ✦ Below are the common methods of a dictionary object:\\n```Python\\n# Accessing a value using a key\\nprint(my_dict[\\'name\\'])  \\n# Output: Alice\\n\\n\\n# Using the get method to access a value\\nprint(my_dict.get(\\'age\\'))  \\n# Output: 25\\n\\n\\n# Adding a new key-value pair\\nmy_dict[\\'city\\'] = \\'New York\\'\\nprint(my_dict)  \\n# Output: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 25, \\'city\\': \\'New York\\'}\\n\\n\\n# Updating a value\\nmy_dict[\\'age\\'] = 26\\nprint(my_dict)  \\n# Output: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 26, \\'city\\': \\'New York\\'}\\n\\n\\n# Removing a key-value pair using del\\ndel my_dict[\\'city\\']\\nprint(my_dict)  \\n# Output: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 26}\\n\\n\\n# Using the keys method to get a list of all keys\\nprint(my_dict.keys())  \\n# Output: dict_keys([\\'name\\', \\'age\\'])\\n\\n\\n# Using the values method to get a list of all values\\nprint(my_dict.values())  \\n# Output: dict_values([\\'Alice\\', 26])\\n\\n\\n# Using the items method to get a list of all key-value pairs\\nprint(my_dict.items())  \\n# Output: dict_items([(\\'nam```e\\', \\'Alice\\'), (\\'age\\', 26)])\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## File Reading & Writing\\n- ✦ To read the contents of a file on your disk, you can use the built-in `open()` function along with the read() method. Here’s an example:\\xa0\\n\\n### Reading from a File\\n```Python\\n# Open the file in read mode (\\'r\\')\\nwith open(\\'example.txt\\', \\'r\\') as file:\\n    # Read the contents of the file\\n    content = file.read()\\n    print(content)\\n```\\n\\n### Writing to a File\\n\\n- ✦ To write to a file, you’ll also use the open() function, but with the write (\\'w\\') mode. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created:\\n\\n```Python\\n# Open the file in write mode (\\'w\\')\\nwith open(\\'example.txt\\', \\'w\\') as file:\\n    # Write a string to the file\\n    file.write(\\'Hello, World!\\')\\n```\\n\\n### Append to a File\\n\\n- ✦ If you want to add content to the end of an existing file, use the append (\\'a\\') mode:\\n\\n```Python\\n# Open the file in append mode (\\'a\\')\\nwith open(\\'example.txt\\', \\'a\\') as file:\\n    # Append a string to the file\\n    file.write(\\'\\\\nHello again!\\')\\n```\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n## JSON \\n---\\n- ✦ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for structuring and transmitting data between systems.\\n\\t-  It is human-readable and easy for both humans and machines to understand. In JSON, data is organized into key-value pairs, making it ideal for representing complex data structures.\\n\\t-  It is widely used in web APIs, configuration files, and data storage due to its simplicity and versatility.\\n\\t-  Most APIs return the data in JSON format (e.g., data.gov.sg, Telegram\\'s API)\\n\\n> [!tip] While JSON is very similar to Python\\'s dictionary, a key difference to remember is:\\n> - ✦ JSON keys MUST be **strings** enclosed in double quotation marks (\"key\").\\n> - ✦ in JSON, both the keys and values **CANNOT** be enclosed in single quotation marks (e.g., ❌ \\'Ang Mo Kio\\')\\n> - ✦ Dictionary keys can be any hashable object (not restricted to strings). Don\\'y worry if you do not understand this line as it\\'s not critical.\\n\\n---\\n## Reading and Parsing JSON File\\n- ✦ In the cell below, we will read in the file\\xa0`courses.json`\\xa0from the\\xa0`week_02/json`\\xa0folder\\n> [!warning] Please note that the provided JSON structure and the data within it are entirely artificial and have been created for training purposes only.\\n> \\n\\n```Python\\nimport json\\n\\n# Open the file in read mode (\\'r\\')\\nwith open(\\'week_02/json/courses.json\\', \\'r\\') as file:\\n    # Read the contents of the file\\n    json_string = file.read()\\n\\n# To transform the JSON-string into Python Dictionary\\ncourse_data = json.loads(json_string)\\n\\n# Check the data type of the `course_data` object\\nprint(f\"After `loads()`, the data type is {type(course_data)} \\\\n\\\\n\")\\n\\n```\\n![](https://d17lzt44idt8rf.cloudfront.net/aicamp/resources/topic02/Pasted%20image%2020240328133142.png)\\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n![](https://d17lzt44idt8rf.cloudfront.net/aicamp/resources/images/coder-robot-01.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Technique 1: Generate Structured Outputs\\n```Python\\nprompt = f\"\"\"\\nGenerate a list of HDB towns along \\\\\\nwith their populations.\\\\\\nProvide them in JSON format with the following keys:\\ntown_id, town, populations.\\n\"\"\"\\nresponse = get_completion(prompt)\\nprint(response)\\n\\n\\nimport json\\nresponse_dict = json.loads(response)\\ntype(response_dict)\\n```\\n![](https://d17lzt44idt8rf.cloudfront.net/aicamp/resources/topic02/Pasted%20image%2020240328134826.png)\\n\\n- ✦ The **prompt specifies that the output should be in JSON format**, with each entry containing three keys:\\xa0`town_id`,\\xa0`town`, and\\xa0`populations`.\\n\\n- ✦ Here’s a breakdown of the code:\\n\\t- `\"Generate a list of HDB towns along with their populations.\"`: \\n\\t\\t- This is the instruction given to the LLM, asking it to create a `list` object of towns and their populations.\\n\\t- `\"Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: town_id, town, populations.\"\\n\\t\\t- This part of the prompt specifies the desired format (JSON) and the keys for the data structure.\\n\\t- `response = get_completion(prompt)`: \\n\\t\\t- This line calls a function\\xa0`get_completion`\\xa0(which is presumably defined elsewhere in the code or is part of an API) with the\\xa0`prompt`\\xa0as an argument. \\n\\t\\t- The function is expected to interact with the LLM and return its completion, which is a `string` object that contains the JSON string.\\n\\t- `response_dict = json.loads(response)`:\\n\\t\\t- After the JSON string is loaded into\\xa0`response_dict`, this line will return\\xa0`dict`, confirming that\\xa0it\\xa0is indeed a `Python dictionary`.\\n\\n> [!warning] Be cautious when asking LLMs to generate factual numbers\\n> -The models may generate factitious numbers if such information is not included its data during the model training.\\n> - There better approach such as generate factual info based on information from the Internet (may cover in later part of this training)\\n\\n\\n- ✦ It\\'s often useful to convert the dictionary to a `Pandas DataFrame` if we want to process or analyse the data.\\n\\t- Here is the example code on how to do that, continued from the example above\\n```Python\\n# To transform the JSON-string into Pandas DataFrame\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(response_dict[\\'towns\\'])\\ndf\\n```\\n![](https://d17lzt44idt8rf.cloudfront.net/aicamp/resources/topic02/Pasted%20image%2020240328135039.png)\\n\\n- ✦ Here is the sample code that show how we eventually save the LLM output into a CSV file on the local disk.\\n```Python\\n# Save the DataFrame to a local CSV file\\ndf.to_csv(\\'town_population.csv\\', index=False)\\n\\n# Save the DataFrame to a localExcel File\\ndf.to_excel(\\'town_population.xlsx\\', index=False)\\n```\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Technique 2: Include Data in the Prompt\\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600184400490-45644626b302?q=80&w=1740&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\\n\\n```Python\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\'town_population.csv\\')\\ndf\\n```\\n\\n---\\n## Include Tabular Data\\n- **✦ Option 1:** Insert Data as Markdown table \\n\\t- Preferred and anecdotally shows more better understanding by the LLMs\\n```Python\\ndata_in_string = df.to_markdown()\\nprint(data_in_string)\\n```\\n\\n- **✦ Option 2:** Insert Data as JSON String\\n```Python\\ndata_in_string =  df.to_json(orient=\\'records\\')\\nprint(data_in_string)\\n```\\n\\nThe `data_in_string`  can then be injected into the prompt using the f-string formatting technique, which we learnt in [3. Formatting Prompt in Python](Topic%201%20-%20LLM%20&%20Prompt%20Engineering/3.%20Formatting%20Prompt%20in%20Python.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Include Text Files from a Folder\\n```Python\\nimport os\\n\\n# Use .listdir() method to list all the files and directories of a specified location\\nos.listdir(\\'week_02/text_files\\')\\n```\\n\\n```Python\\ndirectory = \\'week_02/text_files\\'\\n\\n# Empty list which will be used to append new values\\nlist_of_text = []\\n\\nfor filename in os.listdir(directory):\\n    # `endswith` with a string method that return True/False based on the evaluation\\n    if filename.endswith(\\'txt\\'):\\n        with open(directory + \\'/\\' + filename) as file:\\n            text_from_file = file.read()\\n            # append the text from the single file to the existing list\\n            list_of_text.append(text_from_file)\\n            print(f\"Successfully read from {filename}\")\\n\\nlist_of_text\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Include Data From the Internet\\n### Web Page\\n```Python\\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\\nimport requests\\n```\\n- ✦ `BeautifulSoup`\\xa0is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, often used for web scraping to extract data from web pages.\\xa0\\n- ✦ `requests`\\xa0is a Python HTTP library that allows you to send HTTP requests easily, such as GET or POST, to interact with web services or fetch data from the web.\\n\\n\\n```Python\\nurl = \"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/04/europe/un-team-sexual-abuse-oct-7-hostages-intl/index.html\"\\n\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\n\\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \\'html.parser\\')\\n\\nfinal_text = soup.text.replace(\\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\')\\n\\nlen(final_text.split())\\n```\\n- ✦ The provided Python code performs web scraping on a specified URL to count the number of words in the text of the webpage. Here’s a brief explanation of each step:\\n\\t1. `url = \"https://edition.cnn.com/...\"`: Sets the variable\\xa0`url`\\xa0to the address of the webpage to be scraped.\\n\\t2. `response = requests.get(url)`: Uses the\\xa0`requests`\\xa0library to perform an HTTP GET request to fetch the content of the webpage at the specified URL.\\n\\t3. `soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \\'html.parser\\')`: Parses the content of the webpage using\\xa0`BeautifulSoup`\\xa0with the\\xa0`html.parser`\\xa0parser, creating a\\xa0`soup`\\xa0object that makes it easy to navigate and search the document tree.\\n\\t4. `final_text = soup.text.replace(\\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\')`: Extracts all the text from the\\xa0`soup`\\xa0object, removing newline characters to create a continuous string of text.\\n\\t5. `len(final_text.split())`: Splits the\\xa0`final_text`\\xa0string into words (using whitespace as the default separator) and counts the number of words using the\\xa0`len()`\\xa0function.\\n\\n- ✦ Then we can use the `final_text` as part of our prompt that pass to LLM.\\n```Python\\n# This example shows the use of angled brackets <> as the delimiters\\nprompt = f\"\"\"\\nSummarize the text delimited by <final_text> tag into a list of key points.\\n\\n<final_text>\\n{final_text}\\n</final_text>\\n\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n\\nresponse = get_completion(prompt)\\nprint(response)\\n```\\n---\\n\\n### API Endpoints\\n\\n- ✦ Open this url in your browser: [https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_68a42f09f350881996d83f9cd73ab02f/view](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_68a42f09f350881996d83f9cd73ab02f/view) and have a quick look at the data.\\n\\n- ✦ We will be using\\xa0`requests`\\xa0package to call this API and get all first 5 rows of data\\n\\t- Note that the\\xa0`resource_id`\\xa0is taken from the URL\\n\\t- If you\\'re interested to find out more about API for data.gov.sg, refer to the\\xa0[official developer guide](https://guide.data.gov.sg/developer-guide/dataset-apis)\\n\\n```Python\\nimport requests\\n# Calling the APIs\\nurl_base = \\'https://data.gov.sg/api/action/datastore_search\\'\\n\\nparameters = {\\n    \\'resource_id\\' : \\'d_68a42f09f350881996d83f9cd73ab02f\\',\\n    \\'limit\\': \\'5\\'\\n}\\nresponse = requests.get(url_base, params=parameters)\\nresponse_dict = response.json()\\nresponse_dict\\n```\\n\\n> [!tip] Tips: Get the dictionary\\'s value with a failsafe\\n> - ✦ When using `.get()` method to retrieve a value from Python dictionary, it can handle the \"missing key\" situation better, by returning a `None` or a default value if the key is not found in the dictionary.\\n> - ✦ This can prevent KeyError exceptions which would occur with square bracket notation if the key is not found.\\n\\n- ✦ Extract the data from the `response` object\\n```Python\\nlist_of_hawkers = []\\nif response_dict.get(\\'result\\') is not None:\\n    records = response_dict[\\'result\\'].get(\\'records\\')\\n    if len(records) > 0 and records is not None:\\n        list_of_hawkers = records\\n```\\n\\n- ✦ Use the data as part of the prompt for LLM\\n```Python\\nprompt = f\"\"\"/\\nwhich is the largest and smallest hawker center, out of the following:\\n\\n<hawker>\\n{list_of_hawkers}\\n</hawker>\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nprint(get_completion(prompt))\\n```\\n\\n\\n---\\n### Table in a Web page\\n\\n-  ✦This function returns all the \"tables\" on the webpage\\n\\t - The table is based on the HTML structure, may differ from the tables we can see on the page rendered through our browser\\n```Python\\n\\nlist_of_tables = pd.read_html(\\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932023_inflation\\')\\nlist_of_tables[0]\\n```\\n\\n-  ✦ Transform the `DataFrame` into Markdown Table string which can be included in a prompt.\\n```Python\\ndf_inflation = list_of_tables[0]\\ndata = df_inflation.to_markdown()\\n```\\n\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Technique 3: Prevent Prompt Injection & Hacking\\n![](https://image.lexica.art/full_webp/23024dfe-f1c9-4aca-b047-7c64b5816b49)\\n\\n\\n- ✦ Preventing prompt injection & leaking can be very difficult, and there exist few robust defenses against it. However, there are some common sense solutions.\\n\\n\\t- For example, if your application does not need to output free-form text, do not allow such outputs as it makes it easier for hackers to key in malicious prompts/code.\\n\\t- There are many different ways to defend against bad actors we will discuss some of the most common ones here.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ However, in many LLM applications, the solutions mentioned above may not be feasible.\\n  \\n\\t- In this subsection, we will discuss a few tactics that we can implement at the prompt-level to defense against such attacks.\\n\\n---\\n## Use Delimiters\\n- ✦ In this example below, we can see how malicious prompts can be injected and change the intended usage of the system\\n\\t- In this case, the user has successfully used a prompt to change our\\xa0`summarize system`\\xa0to a\\xa0`translation system`\\n\\t- We will dive deeper into defence mechanisms in Week 3. Still, what you learn here is a very important first line of defence.\\n```Python'),\n",

It’s akin to setting how “creative” or “safe” you want the model’s responses to be. \\n\\n\\n- **✦ Technically, it adjusts the probability distribution of the next token** being generated, influencing the diversity of the generated text\\n\\t- `Softmax function` is often used in machine learning models to convert raw scores (also known as logits) into probabilities.\\n\\t- In the context of language models, the softmax function is used to convert the scores assigned to each possible next word into probabilities. The word with the highest probability is often chosen as the prediction.\\n\\t\\t- So, if the softmax value for a word is high, it means that the model predicts that word to be the next word with high probability. \\n\\t\\t- Conversely, a low softmax value for a word means that the word is unlikely to be the next word according to the model’s prediction.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ Table below shows candidates of word for completing the prompt *\"Singapore has a lot of beautiful ...\"*.\\n\\t- At a **lower temperature** makes the model’s **predictions more deterministic**, **favoring the most likely next token**. \\n\\t\\t- The resulting probability distribution where one element has a probability close to 1, and all others have probabilities close to 0.\\n\\t\\t\\t- The differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t\\t- In other words, the differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t-  At **higher temperatures*, the new values (i.e., `Softmax with Temperature`) are less extreme**\\n\\t\\t - The resulting probabilities are more evenly distributed. \\n\\t\\t - This leads to **more randomness and creativity in the generated text**, as the model is less likely to pick the most probable token and more likely to pick less probable ones.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ See the following for the illustration of the concept.\\n\\t- There are live examples that we will go through in our notebook\\n\\t- by adjusting the `temperature`, we can control the trade-off between diversity and confidence in the model’s predictions. \\n\\t- A lower theta will make the model more confident but less diverse, while a higher theta will make the model more diverse but less confident.\\n\\n| Word      | Logits | Softmax | Softmax with LOW temperature | Softmax with High tempetaure |\\n| --------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------- | :--------------------------- |\\n| scenaries | 20     | 0.881   | 1.000                        | 0.8808                       |\\n| buildings | 18     | 0.119   | 0.000                        | 0.1192                       |\\n| people    | 5      | 0.000   | 0.000                        | 0.000                        |\\n| gardens   | 2      | 0.000   | 0.000                        | 0.000                        |\\n![](https://d17lzt44idt8rf.cloudfront.net/aicamp/resources/topic02/Pasted%20image%2020240328125030.png)\\n\\n> [!info] **[Extra]** The equations below shows how the \"temperature\" being incorporated into the Softmax function.\\n> - 💡 You don\\'t have to worry about understanding the equation or memorizing it. \\n> - It\\'s more for us to understand the intuition on where is the `temperature` being used\\n> \\n> - **Softmax**\\n> $$ \\\\text{Softmax}_\\\\theta(z_i) = \\\\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_i}}$$\\n> - **Softmax with Temperature $\\\\theta$**\\n$$ \\\\text{Softmax}_\\\\theta(z_i) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{\\\\theta}}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{\\\\theta}}}$$\\n> \\n\\n> [!warning] Calculations that are found on this page are for understanding the intuition behind the key parameters and do not represent the exact ways model providers code their algorithms\\n> - ✦ This applies to the calculations for temperature, top-K, and top-P\\n> \\n\\n> [!Try out in Notebook Week 02] \\n> The live calculation to show the intuition of the `Temperature`  is included in the Notebook of this week.

This issue arises due to the inherent nature of how LLMs are trained and their reliance on massive datasets. \\n\\t- While some of the models like ChatGPT go through a second phase in the training where humans try to improve the responses, there is generally no fact-checking mechanism that is built into these LLMs when you use them.\\n\\n- ✦ There is no easy foolproof safeguard against hallucination, although some system prompt engineering can help mitigate this. \\n\\t- What makes hallucination by LLM worse is that the responses are surprisingly real, even if they are absolutely nonsensical. \\n\\t- Know that you must never take the responses as-is without fact-checking, and that you are ultimately responsible for the use of the output.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Hallucinations &  Common Risks\\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624021097786-e621f5e3d52d?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\\n\\n- ✦ Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for effectively using LLMs and mitigating potential issues.

It’s akin to setting how “creative” or “safe” you want the model’s responses to be. \\n\\n\\n- **✦ Technically, it adjusts the probability distribution of the next token** being generated, influencing the diversity of the generated text\\n\\t- `Softmax function` is often used in machine learning models to convert raw scores (also known as logits) into probabilities.\\n\\t- In the context of language models, the softmax function is used to convert the scores assigned to each possible next word into probabilities. The word with the highest probability is often chosen as the prediction.\\n\\t\\t- So, if the softmax value for a word is high, it means that the model predicts that word to be the next word with high probability. \\n\\t\\t- Conversely, a low softmax value for a word means that the word is unlikely to be the next word according to the model’s prediction.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ Table below shows candidates of word for completing the prompt *\"Singapore has a lot of beautiful ...\"*.\\n\\t- At a **lower temperature** makes the model’s **predictions more deterministic**, **favoring the most likely next token**. \\n\\t\\t- The resulting probability distribution where one element has a probability close to 1, and all others have probabilities close to 0.\\n\\t\\t\\t- The differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t\\t- In other words, the differences between logits are amplified, making the highest logit much more likely to be selected by the `softmax function`.\\n\\t-  At **higher temperatures*, the new values (i.e., `Softmax with Temperature`) are less extreme**\\n\\t\\t - The resulting probabilities are more evenly distributed. \\n\\t\\t - This leads to **more randomness and creativity in the generated text**, as the model is less likely to pick the most probable token and more likely to pick less probable ones.\\n\\n\\n- ✦ See the following for the illustration of the concept.\\n\\t- There are live examples that we will go through in our notebook\\n\\t- by adjusting the `temperature`, we can control the trade-off between diversity and confidence in the model’s predictions. \\n\\t- A lower theta will make the model more confident but less diverse, while a higher theta will make the model more diverse but less confident.\\n\\n| Word      | Logits | Softmax | Softmax with LOW temperature | Softmax with High tempetaure |\\n| --------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------- | :--------------------------- |\\n| scenaries | 20     | 0.881   | 1.000                        | 0.8808                       |\\n| buildings | 18     | 0.119   | 0.000                        | 0.1192                       |\\n| people    | 5      | 0.000   | 0.000                        | 0.000                        |\\n| gardens   | 2      | 0.000   | 0.000                        | 0.000                        |\\n![](https://d17lzt44idt8rf.cloudfront.net/aicamp/resources/topic02/Pasted%20image%2020240328125030.png)\\n\\n> [!info] **[Extra]** The equations below shows how the \"temperature\" being incorporated into the Softmax function.\\n> - 💡 You don\\'t have to worry about understanding the equation or memorizing it. \\n> - It\\'s more for us to understand the intuition on where is the `temperature` being used\\n> \\n> - **Softmax**\\n> $$ \\\\text{Softmax}_\\\\theta(z_i) = \\\\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_i}}$$\\n> - **Softmax with Temperature $\\\\theta$**\\n$$ \\\\text{Softmax}_\\\\theta(z_i) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{\\\\theta}}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{\\\\theta}}}$$\\n> \\n\\n> [!warning] Calculations that are found on this page are for understanding the intuition behind the key parameters and do not represent the exact ways model providers code their algorithms\\n> - ✦ This applies to the calculations for temperature, top-K, and top-P\\n> \\n\\n> [!Try out in Notebook Week 02] \\n> The live calculation to show the intuition of the `Temperature`  is included in the Notebook of this week.

Then it samples the next word from this set.\\n\\t- Top-P sampling gives us a subset of words whose cumulative probability exceeds a certain threshold (P), making it a useful method for narrowing down a list of candidates based on their probabilities.\\n\\t\\n> [!tip] In practice, either `Top-K` or `Top-P` is used, but not both at the same time.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'notes/4. Prompting Techniques for Builders.txt'}, page_content='<h1>Title: Prompting Techniques for Builders</h1>\\n\\n\\n# Basic Concepts:\\n\\n\\n## Dictionary: A Quick Recap\\n- ✦ In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that stores data in key-value pairs.\\n\\t- The dictionary is enclosed in curly braces { } where the key-value pairs are stored in.\\n\\t- Each key-value pair is separated by commas.\\n\\t- Within each key-value pair, the key comes first, followed by a colon, and then followed by the corresponding value.\\n\\t- Here’s an example:\\n\\n```Python\\nmy_dict = {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 25}\\n```\\n\\n- ✦ In this example, \\'name\\' and \\'age\\' are keys, and \\'Alice\\' and 25 are their corresponding values. Keys in a dictionary must be unique and immutable, which means you can use strings, numbers, or tuples as - dictionary keys but something like [\\'key\\'] is not allowed.\\n    \\n- ✦ Below are the common methods of a dictionary object:\\n```Python\\n# Accessing a value using a key\\nprint(my_dict[\\'name\\'])  \\n# Output: Alice\\n\\n\\n# Using the get method to access a value\\nprint(my_dict.get(\\'age\\'))  \\n# Output: 25\\n\\n\\n# Adding a new key-value pair\\nmy_dict[\\'city\\'] = \\'New York\\'\\nprint(my_dict)  \\n# Output: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 25, \\'city\\': \\'New York\\'}\\n\\n\\n# Updating a value\\nmy_dict[\\'age\\'] = 26\\nprint(my_dict)  \\n# Output: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 26, \\'city\\': \\'New York\\'}\\n\\n\\n# Removing a key-value pair using del\\ndel my_dict[\\'city\\']\\nprint(my_dict)  \\n# Output: {\\'name\\': \\'Alice\\', \\'age\\': 26}\\n\\n\\n# Using the keys method to get a list of all keys\\nprint(my_dict.keys())  \\n# Output: dict_keys([\\'name\\', \\'age\\'])\\n\\n\\n# Using the values method to get a list of all values\\nprint(my_dict.values())  \\n# Output: dict_values([\\'Alice\\', 26])\\n\\n\\n# Using the items method to get a list of all key-value pairs\\nprint(my_dict.items())  \\n# Output: dict_items([(\\'nam```e\\', \\'Alice\\'), (\\'age\\', 26)])\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## File Reading & Writing\\n- ✦ To read the contents of a file on your disk, you can use the built-in `open()` function along with the read() method. Here’s an example:\\xa0\\n\\n### Reading from a File\\n```Python\\n# Open the file in read mode (\\'r\\')\\nwith open(\\'example.txt\\', \\'r\\') as file:\\n    # Read the contents of the file\\n    content = file.read()\\n    print(content)\\n```\\n\\n### Writing to a File\\n\\n- ✦ To write to a file, you’ll also use the open() function, but with the write (\\'w\\') mode. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created:\\n\\n```Python\\n# Open the file in write mode (\\'w\\')\\nwith open(\\'example.txt\\', \\'w\\') as file:\\n    # Write a string to the file\\n    file.write(\\'Hello, World!\\')\\n```\\n\\n### Append to a File\\n\\n- ✦ If you want to add content to the end of an existing file, use the append (\\'a\\') mode:\\n\\n```Python\\n# Open the file in append mode (\\'a\\')\\nwith open(\\'example.txt\\', \\'a\\') as file:\\n    # Append a string to the file\\n    file.write(\\'\\\\nHello again!\\')\\n```\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n## JSON \\n---\\n- ✦ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for structuring and transmitting data between systems.\\n\\t-  It is human-readable and easy for both humans and machines to understand. In JSON, data is organized into key-value pairs, making it ideal for representing complex data structures.\\n\\t-  It is widely used in web APIs, configuration files, and data storage due to its simplicity and versatility.\\n\\t-  Most APIs return the data in JSON format (e.g., data.gov.sg, Telegram\\'s API)\\n\\n> [!tip] While JSON is very similar to Python\\'s dictionary, a key difference to remember is:\\n> - ✦ JSON keys MUST be **strings** enclosed in double quotation marks (\"key\").\\n> - ✦ in JSON, both the keys and values **CANNOT** be enclosed in single quotation marks (e.g., ❌ \\'Ang Mo Kio\\')\\n> - ✦ Dictionary keys can be any hashable object (not restricted to strings).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'notes/3. LLMs and Hallucinations.txt'}, page_content='<h1>Title: LLMs and Hallucinations</h1>\\n\\n\\n# LLMs & Hallucinations\\n- ✦ One important thing to take note of when using such AI powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they often generate text that appears coherent and contextually relevant but is factually incorrect or misleading. \\n\\t- We call these **hallucination problems**. This issue arises due to the inherent nature of how LLMs are trained and their reliance on massive datasets. \\n\\t- While some of the models like ChatGPT go through a second phase in the training where humans try to improve the responses, there is generally no fact-checking mechanism that is built into these LLMs when you use them.\\n\\n- ✦ There is no easy foolproof safeguard against hallucination, although some system prompt engineering can help mitigate this. \\n\\t- What makes hallucination by LLM worse is that the responses are surprisingly real, even if they are absolutely nonsensical. \\n\\t- Know that you must never take the responses as-is without fact-checking, and that you are ultimately responsible for the use of the output.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n<br>\\n\\n# Hallucinations &  Common Risks\\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624021097786-e621f5e3d52d?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\\n\\n- ✦ Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for effectively using LLMs and mitigating potential issues. We will explore some of the common pitfalls of LLMs, including issues with:\\n\\t- citing source\\n\\t- bias\\n\\t- hallucinations\\n\\t- math\\n\\t- prompt hacking\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔖 Citing Non-existance Sources\\n- ✦ Citing Sources While LLMs can generate text that appears to cite sources, **it\\'s important to note that they cannot accurately cite sources.** \\n\\t- This is because they do not have access to the Internet and do not have the ability to remember where their training data came from. \\n\\t- As a result, **they often generate sources that seem plausible but are entirely fabricated**. \\n\\t- This is a significant limitation when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate source citation.\\n\\t- Note The issue of inaccurate source citation can be mitigated to some extent by using search augmented LLMs (i.e., RAG that we will be covering). \\n\\t\\t- These are LLMs that have the ability to search the Internet and other sources to provide more accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧐 Bias\\n- ✦ LLMs can exhibit biasness in their responses, often generating **stereotypical or prejudiced content**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large datasets that may contain biased information. \\n\\t- Despite safeguards put in place to prevent this, LLMs can sometimes produce sexist, racist, or homophobic content. \\n\\t- This is a **critical issue to be aware** of when using LLMs in **consumer-facing applications** or in research, as it can l**ead to the propagation of harmful stereotypes and biased results.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🥴 Hallucinations\\n- ✦  LLMs can sometimes \"hallucinate\" or generate false information when asked a question they do not know the answer to. \\n\\t- Instead of stating that they do not know the answer, they often generate a response that sounds confident but is incorrect. \\n\\t- This can lead to the dissemination of misinformation and should be taken into account when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔢 Math \\n- ✦ Despite their advanced capabilities, **Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical tasks and can provide incorrect answers (even as simple as multiplying two numbers).**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large volumes of text and while they have gained a good understanding of natural language patterns, they are not explicitly trained to do maths.\\n\\t- Note The issue with math can be somewhat alleviated by using a **tool augmented LLM**\\n\\t\\t- which combines the capabilities of an LLM with specialized tools for tasks like math or programming.\\n\\t\\t- We will cover this in later part of the training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👺 Prompt Hacking\\n- ✦ LLMs can be **manipulated or \"hacked\" by users** to generate specific content, and then use our LLM applications **for malicious or unintended usages**.\\n\\t- This is known as prompt hacking and can be used to trick the LLM into generating inappropriate or harmful content. \\n\\t- It\\'s important to be aware of this potential issue when using LLMs, especially in public-facing applications. \\n\\t- We will cover prompting techniques that can prevent some of of the prompt attacks/hacking techniques.')]"

We will explore some of the common pitfalls of LLMs, including issues with:\\n\\t- citing source\\n\\t- bias\\n\\t- hallucinations\\n\\t- math\\n\\t- prompt hacking\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔖 Citing Non-existance Sources\\n- ✦ Citing Sources While LLMs can generate text that appears to cite sources, **it\\'s important to note that they cannot accurately cite sources.** \\n\\t- This is because they do not have access to the Internet and do not have the ability to remember where their training data came from. \\n\\t- As a result, **they often generate sources that seem plausible but are entirely fabricated**. \\n\\t- This is a significant limitation when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate source citation.\\n\\t- Note The issue of inaccurate source citation can be mitigated to some extent by using search augmented LLMs (i.e., RAG that we will be covering). \\n\\t\\t- These are LLMs that have the ability to search the Internet and other sources to provide more accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧐 Bias\\n- ✦ LLMs can exhibit biasness in their responses, often generating **stereotypical or prejudiced content**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large datasets that may contain biased information. \\n\\t- Despite safeguards put in place to prevent this, LLMs can sometimes produce sexist, racist, or homophobic content. \\n\\t- This is a **critical issue to be aware** of when using LLMs in **consumer-facing applications** or in research, as it can l**ead to the propagation of harmful stereotypes and biased results.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🥴 Hallucinations\\n- ✦  LLMs can sometimes \"hallucinate\" or generate false information when asked a question they do not know the answer to. \\n\\t- Instead of stating that they do not know the answer, they often generate a response that sounds confident but is incorrect. \\n\\t- This can lead to the dissemination of misinformation and should be taken into account when using LLMs for tasks that require accurate information.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🔢 Math \\n- ✦ Despite their advanced capabilities, **Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical tasks and can provide incorrect answers (even as simple as multiplying two numbers).**\\n\\t- This is because they are trained on large volumes of text and while they have gained a good understanding of natural language patterns, they are not explicitly trained to do maths.\\n\\t- Note The issue with math can be somewhat alleviated by using a **tool augmented LLM**\\n\\t\\t- which combines the capabilities of an LLM with specialized tools for tasks like math or programming.\\n\\t\\t- We will cover this in later part of the training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👺 Prompt Hacking\\n- ✦ LLMs can be **manipulated or \"hacked\" by users** to generate specific content, and then use our LLM applications **for malicious or unintended usages**.\\n\\t- This is known as prompt hacking and can be used to trick the LLM into generating inappropriate or harmful content. \\n\\t- It\\'s important to be aware of this potential issue when using LLMs, especially in public-facing applications. \\n\\t- We will cover prompting techniques that can prevent some of of the prompt attacks/hacking techniques.'),\n",

    "The term np.max(logits) is subtracted from logits to avoid numerical instability that can occur when taking the exponential of large numbers, a common issue in machine learning computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why: the softmax function involves taking the exponential of each logit. If a logit is a large positive number, its exponential can be extremely large - so large that it exceeds the maximum representable number (overflow), leading to inf values. This can cause the softmax function to return incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By subtracting np.max(logits), we ensure that the maximum value in the logits array is 0, which means the largest possible output from the exponential function is 1. This effectively eliminates the possibility of overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, this operation doesn't change the output of the softmax function. That's because softmax is shift invariant, meaning that adding or subtracting a constant from each logit doesn't affect the output probabilities. This property allows us to subtract the maximum logit for numerical stability without changing the function's output.\n",
