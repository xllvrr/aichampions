    "- In this use case, we will be building a \"system\" that helps to respond to customer's enquiries on training courses.\n",
    "- This notebook is designed to guide you through the process of creating a simplified \"end-to-end system\" that leverages advanced prompting and chaining techniques that we have learnt in topic 3 of the Bootcamp. These techniques allow for more complex and interactive user experiences, as they enable the system to ask follow-up questions based on user input and maintain context across multiple interactions (similar to ChatGPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here's what you can expect from this notebook:  \n",
    "    - **Data Preparation**: This includes loading and preparing the data. The data includes details about various training courses, such as course name, category, duration, price, etc, that are stored in a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Query Categorization**: We will develop a function to categorize incoming user queries. This function will help us understand whether the user is asking about a specific course, having account issues, facing registration problems, or other types of queries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Course Information Retrieval**: Based on the categorized queries, we will retrieve relevant course information from our data. For instance, if a user is asking about a specific course, we will fetch all the details related to that course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Response Generation**: After retrieving the necessary information, we will generate a response to the user's query. The response will be informative and detailed, providing the user with all the information they need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Malicious Intent Detection**: To ensure the safety and integrity of our system, we will implement a function to detect any malicious intentions in the user's queries, such as attempts to inject harmful instructions.  \n",

    "- You've successfully built a function that identifies relevant courses from user queries. Now, let's take it a step further!\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variable `course_details_database`, from Question 2A, is a dictonary object where each key is a `course_name` and the value is another dictionary containing detailed information about that course (e.g., instructor, duration, price).\n",

    "1. **Name:** `get_course_details`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameter:** `list_of_category_n_course` - a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a course and has the keys `category` and `course_name`. This is the expected output format from the previous course identification function (in Question 2B).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functionality:**\n",
    "    - Iterate through the provided `list_of_category_n_course`.\n",
    "    - For each course, extract the `course_name`.\n",
    "    - Use the `course_name` to look up the corresponding course details in the `dict_of_courses` dictionary.\n",

    "- **Function Input:**\n",
    "  * `user_message`: A string containing the user's query about the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Design:**\n",
    "   - Construct a `system_message` string that guides the LLM through the following steps:\n",
    "     - **Step 1:** Understand the relevant courses and their details from the `relevant_courses_list`.\n",
    "     - **Step 2:** Utilize the course information to generate a detailed and accurate answer to the user's query.\n",
    "     - **Step 3:** Ensure the response to client must only rely on the facts or information in the course information. The response should be as detail and elaborated as possible and include information that is useful for customer to better understand the course.\n",
    "     - **Step 4:** Review and revised the response to ensure the response is in a friendly tone, ensuring factual accuracy and comprehensiveness. Include details like ratings, pricing, and skills learned. Employ Neural Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques to enhance the persuasiveness and effectiveness of the response.\n",
    "   - Use the provided `step_delimiter` (`####`) to clearly separate each step in the prompt and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Message Construction:**\n",
    "   - Create a `messages` list containing two dictionaries:\n",
    "     - The first dictionary represents the system message with the role `'system'` and the content `system_message`.\n",
    "     - The second dictionary represents the user message with the role `'user'` and the content `user_message`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response Generation and Extraction:**\n",
    "   - Call the `get_completion_from_messages` function with the `messages` list and `max_tokens` set to 3500 to obtain the LLM's response.\n",
    "   - Extract the `final response` to the user from the LLM's output by splitting the response string using the `step_delimiter` and taking the last element.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return:**\n",
